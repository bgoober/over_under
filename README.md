# Over / Under

A round-based betting game. Players bet on the outcome of a random number; whether it will be Over or Under (higher or lower), than the previous round's random number. Loser pay winners. If the new random number is the same as the previous round's random number, or if all players bet incorrectly, then the House wins.
